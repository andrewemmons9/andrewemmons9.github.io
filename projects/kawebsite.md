This is a project that was almost a gateway into web development for myself. During the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to design and build a website to help gather information for an election for the Korean Association. This election was between two presidents, which had over 2,300 voters. The information of all of these voters went through a program that I built which connected to a database. The data was then saved, and given to the Korean Association for further analyzation. 

My role as the web developer, was to design and maintain a website whiched helped assist with the collection of data entries. I was able to work with front end languages such as HTML and CSS to design the website. For the back end of the website, I used PHP and MySql to collect and send the data entries to the server host. I was able to efficiently gather and maintain the website the whole time, and fix anything that had to be updated. At the end of the election, we had over 2,300 data entries, that consisted of voters in this election.

This experience taught me how to develop, maintain, and manage a website under my own constraint. It taught me the value of learning on your own, and that there is always something new to be learned, which will be beneficial. I was able to work with things in cPanel, such as PHPMyAdmin and file uploading. I learned how to effectively publish a website on the internet, and purchase a domain name as well as a server host. All in all, this has opened my eyes up to the field of Web Development, which is what I would like to pursue.
