To begin, I believe that Javascript is a great programming language because of it's versatility and ability to construct things like in Java. As a beginner to Javascript, I found it a bit easier to pick up because of it's simplicity. However, compared to the other programming languages, such as Java, that we learned from previous semesters, it seems to be similiar when it comes to problem solving like declaring variables and such. The most difficult part in this programming language was learning the different syntax. I believe this programming language will be useful for us as Software Developers when it comes to designing and creating functions to make web pages work more effectively. 

WOD's give us the opportunity to experience computer coding in a hands on manner that seems relative to that of a work environment. This style of learning is stressful, but it also gives us a better understanding of where we actually are in terms of our skill with the programming language. I believe that this will be beneficial for all of us as students and myself to develop hands on programming experience and to figure out how we as individuals will problem solve better under pressure.

All in all, I am more than excited to begin my journey learning Javascript! I can't wait to see how we will use Javascript in ways that will open our eyes up to different career paths, and how we will be able to apply it.
